## Getting Started
Required packages: [keras 2.0.6](https://keras.io/), [numpy 1.12.1](http://www.numpy.org/), [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Neural Networks from scratch by Python.
Under MLP folder, run:
···
python main.py
···
By default parameter, it would launch a cross-validating training with different hidden neurons in range (64, 1024, 64).


## CNN
Under CNN folder, run:
···
python main.py
